- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Giampiero Sciarra (@Gsciarra).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology, science, psychology and a lot of nerd stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always studying and trying new technology because I am a frontender for the job, but I'm a full-stack for fun. I like to be able to realize projects all on my own. (Don't misinterpret me; I love team play, and I would never work alone.) 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsciarrawebdeveloper/)
